## Background

Security is an exercise in managing risk. Reviewing the common root causes of security incidents is an effective way to guide prioritized remediation efforts.

This repository seeks to index all publicly disclosed AWS customer security incidents with a known root cause. It will exclude incidents involving exposed data stores (e.g S3 bucket leaks, exposed managed or hosted databases). Those incidents are already well understood, and examples can be found cataloged in places like https://github.com/nagwww/s3-leaks, https://www.upguard.com/breaches, https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/02/21/leaky-buckets-in-2022/ and Corey Quinn's [LWIAWS](https://www.lastweekinaws.com) S3 Bucket Negligence Award.

It also exludes incidents impacting individuals, such as the periodic cryptomining due to compromised credentials.

The intial data was collected for a talk at BSidesCT 2020: _Learning from AWS (Customer) Security Incidents_

### A Note on Blameless Postmortems

This repository is in no way intended as a criticism of the listed companies. In the spirit of blameless postmortems [<sup>1</sup>](#1), our goal is to learn from incidents without an atmosphere of blame.
